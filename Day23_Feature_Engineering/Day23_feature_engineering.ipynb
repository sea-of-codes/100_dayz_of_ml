        "Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into meaningful features that improve the performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms.  \n",
        "It lies at the heart of the ML pipeline because **better features → better models**.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 1. Data Collection & Retrieval\n",
        "- Gather raw data from databases, APIs, sensors, logs, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Data Processing & Wrangling\n",
        "- Handle missing values  \n",
        "- Remove duplicates  \n",
        "- Handle inconsistent data types  \n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Feature Transformation\n",
        "- Missing Value Imputation (mean, median, mode, KNN imputation)  \n",
        "- Handling Categorical Features (one-hot encoding, label encoding, embeddings)  \n",
        "- Outlier Detection & Treatment (Z-score, IQR, winsorization)  \n",
        "- Feature Scaling (Normalization, Standardization, Min-Max scaling, Robust scaling)  \n",
        "- Log transforms, Box-Cox/Yeo-Johnson transforms for skewed data  \n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Feature Extraction\n",
        "- From unstructured data (PCA, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, CNN features for images)  \n",
        "- Domain-specific extraction (statistical features, Fourier transforms, etc.)  \n",

        "### 5. Feature Construction\n",
        "- Creating new features from existing ones  \n",
        "Examples:  \n",
        "  - Date-time decomposition (year, month, day, weekday, season)  \n",
        "  - Interaction terms (feature1 × feature2)  \n",
        "  - Polynomial features  \n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Feature Selection\n",
        "- Reduce dimensionality, improve model efficiency  \n",
        "- Filter methods: Correlation, Chi-square test  \n",
